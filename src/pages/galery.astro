                    artdsc=`The Starry Night is an oil on canvas painting by the Dutch post-impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh. Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, just before dawn, with the addition of an imaginary village. Van Gogh depicted the view at different times of the day, including sunrise, moonrise, sunny days, cloudy days, windy days, and a rainy day. Although the hospital staff did not allow Van Gogh to paint in his bedroom, there he was able to make sketches in ink or charcoal on paper; Eventually, I would base newer variations on older versions.​​​`

It was acquired by King Francis I of France at the beginning of the 16th century and has been property of the French State since then. Through historical studies it has been determined that the model could be a neighbor of Leonardo, that her descendants could be known and that the model could have been pregnant, due to the way she hides her hands.`
